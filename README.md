## Is Yelp the gamechanger?
What is the effect of a Las Vegas restaurantâ€™s Yelp ratings on its two year survival status? Can we determine counterfactual probability of 2 year survival had all restaurants received Yelp ratings above some threshold and the counterfactual probability of 2 year survival had all restaurants received Yelp ratings below some threshold?
