# Scream, Shout, and Yelp(?) for Causal Inference
When you think Vegas, you may think of blue colored men, all-you-can-eat buffets, and perhaps, the university! What about gambling? Taking a chance to make a win? Well, running a business can somewhat be a gamble. That being said...

## Is Yelp the gamechanger?
What is the effect of a Las Vegas restaurantâ€™s Yelp ratings on its two year survival status? Can we determine counterfactual probability of 2 year survival had all restaurants received Yelp ratings above some threshold and the counterfactual probability of 2 year survival had all restaurants received Yelp ratings below some threshold?

## Our results
We made some negligent assumptions in order to get our problem into the causal framework. We have since learned that some of this assumptions we could have relaxed. I don't think we'll ever be returning to this project, but if you'd like to use the data we have, can you give us a little cite? We didn't create it but we put it together (with lots of effort!) in this project.

Our results were a definite no. Yelp is not the gamechanger in our project. Higher Yelp reviews give off higher closure rates in Las Vegas.
